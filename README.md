# Simulate-breast-cancer-recurrence-with-r
The breast cancer dataset of UCI ML repository is analysed with r program 
This project replicates the Breast Cancer (Ljubljana) dataset of the UCI Machine Learning Repository to simulate breast cancer recurrence with R programming. Nine clinical and demographic predictors are included in the dataset such as age, tumor size, menopause, and malignancy extent. Following data cleaning and preparation, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to determine influential patterns that affect recurrence. Three supervised machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were trained and compared . Among them, Decision tree model performed best with high accuracy and the model has been shown to have very good predictive power for recurrence results. From the outcomes, it can be demonstrated that tumor size, age , involved lymph nodes, and extent of malignancy are the parameters that play a significant role in recurrence risk. Overall, the study highlights how data science techniques can assist clinical decision-making as well as improve cancer early detection.
